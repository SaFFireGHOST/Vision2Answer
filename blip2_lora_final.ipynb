    "# Visual Question Answering (VQA) System with LoRA Fine-Tuned BLIP-2\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a VQA system using the BLIP-2 model (`Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b`) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the dataset at `/kaggle/input/vr-project-json/vqa_training_data_complete.json`. It processes images and questions, generates one-word answers, and evaluates performance using metrics like Exact Match, Token Match, WUP Score, F1 Score, and BERTScore. The system leverages mixed precision training, gradient checkpointing, and the `accelerate` library for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Load and preprocess image metadata and VQA dataset.\n",
    "- Split data into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.\n",
    "- Fine-tune BLIP-2 using LoRA with a custom dataset, mixed precision, and distributed training.\n",
    "- Run inference to generate one-word answers on the validation set.\n",
    "- Evaluate predictions with comprehensive metrics, including yes/no question analysis.\n",
    "- Perform error analysis and visualize results, including answer length comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Python libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `peft`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `accelerate`.\n",
    "- NLTK data: `wordnet`, `punkt`, `averaged_perceptron_tagger`, `averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng`.\n",
    "- Dataset: Images and a JSON file with VQA questions and answers.\n",
    "- Hardware: GPU required (CUDA support) for fine-tuning and inference."
